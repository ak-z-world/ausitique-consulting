  question: "What Is GST Registration?",
  answer:
    // "GST (Goods and Services Tax) is a unified tax system in India that replaced multiple indirect taxes like VAT, Service Tax, Excise Duty, etc. It is mandatory for businesses that meet specific turnover criteria or operate across states.When you register, you receive a unique 15-digit GSTIN (GST Identification Number) issued by the Government of India. This number is used for collecting and remitting GST and for claiming Input Tax Credit (ITC).",
    "Goods and Services Tax (GST) is one of the most significant tax reforms in India, introduced to create a unified and transparent system of indirect taxation. Prior to GST, businesses had to deal with multiple taxes such as VAT, Service Tax, Excise Duty, Octroi, Entry Tax, and several state-level levies, which created confusion, compliance burden, and cases of double taxation. With the implementation of GST, all these indirect taxes were subsumed into a single, comprehensive tax structure, making it easier for businesses to operate across India under one standardized system. GST was officially rolled out on July 1, 2017, and has since become the backbone of India’s indirect taxation.GST applies to almost all goods and services, and businesses meeting the prescribed turnover criteria are required to register under GST. It is also mandatory for companies and individuals engaged in inter-state supply of goods or services, e-commerce operators, and certain other categories of businesses, regardless of turnover. Once registered, every taxpayer is issued a unique 15-digit GST Identification Number (GSTIN) by the Government of India. This GSTIN acts as a unique identity for the business and is used for filing returns, collecting and paying GST, and availing various benefits under the system.One of the biggest advantages of GST is the concept of Input Tax Credit (ITC). Under the old tax regime, businesses often faced the problem of “tax on tax,” as they could not claim credit for taxes already paid at earlier stages of production or supply. GST eliminates this cascading effect by allowing taxpayers to claim credit for the GST they pay on purchases against the tax they collect on sales. ",
