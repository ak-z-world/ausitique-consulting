  question: "What Is ITR-4 (Sugam) Return Filing?",
  answer:
    // " ITR-4, also known as Sugam, is a simplified return form under the Income Tax Act, 1961 for taxpayers opting for presumptive income under Sections 44AD, 44ADA, or 44AE. It is ideal for small businesses, professionals, and goods vehicle owners who want to reduce compliance burdens and report estimated income.",
    "ITR-4, also known as Sugam, is a simplified Income Tax Return form introduced under the Income Tax Act, 1961. It is specifically designed for taxpayers who have opted for the presumptive taxation scheme under Sections 44AD, 44ADA, or 44AE. The purpose of this form is to reduce the compliance burden on small taxpayers by allowing them to declare income on a presumptive basis rather than maintaining detailed books of accounts. This makes the return-filing process faster, easier, and more convenient, especially for individuals and businesses with relatively straightforward financial structures.The presumptive taxation scheme under Section 44AD is mainly meant for small businesses with a turnover of up to ₹2 crore, while Section 44ADA applies to professionals such as doctors, lawyers, architects, and consultants with gross receipts up to ₹50 lakh. Similarly, Section 44AE caters to owners of goods transport vehicles, where income is declared based on the number and capacity of vehicles owned rather than actual records of income and expenses. By using ITR-4, these taxpayers can declare their income at a prescribed percentage of turnover or receipts and avoid the need for complex accounting, auditing, or detailed expense tracking.ITR-4 is best suited for resident individuals, Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), and partnership firms (other than LLPs) who earn income from business or profession under the presumptive taxation scheme. However, it is not applicable to companies, LLPs, or taxpayers who have income from capital gains, multiple house properties, foreign assets, or who are directors in companies. In such cases, more detailed forms like ITR-3 must be used.",
