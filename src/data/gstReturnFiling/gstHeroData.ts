  question: "What Is GST Return Filing?",
  answer:
    "A GST Return is a legally mandated statement that captures the financial activity of a business, including details of sales, purchases, output tax collected, and input tax credit (ITC) claimed. Filing GST returns is compulsory for all GST-registered businesses in India under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Act. These returns help the government calculate the net GST liability by reconciling the tax collected with the tax paid on inputs. Depending on your annual turnover and business category, GST return filing may be monthly, quarterly through the QRMP scheme, or annually in the case of forms like GSTR-9. Timely GST return filing not only ensures compliance with GST regulations but also prevents penalties, late fees, and interest charges. Moreover, it allows businesses to claim accurate input tax credit, improve working capital, and maintain transparent tax records. Today, most businesses prefer online GST return filing through the GST portal, where forms such as GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, and GSTR-9 can be submitted digitally with invoice matching and reconciliation features. By meeting the GST return due dates and maintaining accurate data, businesses can stay compliant, avoid tax notices, and ensure smooth operations under India’s unified tax system.",
