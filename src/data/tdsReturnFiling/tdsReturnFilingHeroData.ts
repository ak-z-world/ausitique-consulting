  question: " What Is TDS Return Filing?",
  answer:
    "TDS Return Filing refers to the process of submitting details of tax deducted at source to the Income Tax Department of India. Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is a mechanism introduced by the government to collect tax at the very point where income is generated. Under this system, a specified percentage of tax is deducted by the payer at the time of making certain payments such as salary, rent, interest, commission, professional fees, contractual payments, and other specified incomes.The person or entity responsible for making the payment—known as the deductor—is legally required to deduct TDS and deposit the deducted amount with the government within the prescribed due dates through the online income tax portal. After depositing the tax, the deductor must file a TDS return on a quarterly basis, providing detailed information such as the amount paid, tax deducted, challan details, and the Permanent Account Number (PAN) of both the deductor and the deductee.TDS return filing is mandatory under the Income Tax Act, 1961, and helps the government track tax collections efficiently while ensuring transparency and accountability. It also enables taxpayers to receive proper credit for the tax deducted in their Form 26AS, which can be claimed while filing their income tax returns.Failure to file TDS returns accurately or on time can result in consequences such as interest on late payment, late filing fees under Section 234E, penalties under Section 271H, and even prosecution in severe cases.",
