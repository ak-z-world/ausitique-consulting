  question: "What Is ITR-3 Return Filing?",
  answer:
    // "ITR-3 is an income tax return form meant for individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who earn income from a proprietary business, profession, or other complex sources such as capital gains, multiple properties, foreign assets, or as directors in a company.",
    "ITR-3 is one of the most comprehensive Income Tax Return forms introduced by the Income Tax Department of India. It is specifically designed for individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who have income from sources that go beyond the simplicity of salary, pension, or single-house property income. The form caters to taxpayers whose financial activities are broader and more complex, ensuring that every stream of income is properly accounted for under the law. Unlike simpler return forms like ITR-1 or ITR-2, which are meant for salaried individuals or those with limited income sources, ITR-3 focuses on those who run businesses, practice professions, or deal with multiple categories of income at once.One of the primary groups required to file ITR-3 are individuals who earn through a proprietary business or profession. This includes self-employed professionals such as doctors, lawyers, architects, consultants, or freelancers, as well as sole proprietors running their own businesses. The form also applies to those who generate income from capital gains, such as profits from selling real estate, shares, bonds, or mutual funds. Furthermore, people who own multiple properties and earn rental income or incur a loss on them must disclose the details through ITR-3.Another important category covered by ITR-3 includes individuals who have international financial interests. If a taxpayer holds foreign assets, earns income abroad, or has foreign bank accounts and investments, then filing ITR-3 becomes mandatory. Similarly, those who serve as directors in companies or hold shares in unlisted companies are required to use this form for accurate compliance.",
