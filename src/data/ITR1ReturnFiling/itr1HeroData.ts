  question: "What Is ITR-1 Sahaj Return Filing?",
  answer:
    "ITR-1, popularly known as Sahaj, is a simplified income tax return form introduced under the Income Tax Act, 1961, for resident individuals with a total income of up to ₹50,00,000 from eligible sources. This return is primarily designed for salaried employees, pensioners, and individuals with income from a single house property or interest from savings accounts, deposits, or other permissible sources. Since it caters to the majority of salaried taxpayers, ITR-1 offers a convenient and hassle-free method to disclose income, claim deductions under various sections like 80C and 80D, and calculate the correct tax liability. The online filing of ITR-1 has made tax compliance simpler, as most details are now auto-populated from Form 16, Form 26AS, and the Annual Information Statement (AIS), reducing the chances of errors and saving time for taxpayers. However, this form cannot be used by individuals with income from capital gains, multiple house properties, business or profession, or foreign assets and income. Filing ITR-1 before the due date not only ensures compliance with Indian tax laws but also helps in building a valid financial record, which can be useful for loan applications, visa approvals, and maintaining transparency in income reporting.",
