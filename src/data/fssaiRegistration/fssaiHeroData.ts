  question: "What is FSSAI Registration?",
  answer:
    "FSSAI Registration is the official authorization process required for any food-related business operating in India. It is governed by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and ensures that the food manufactured, stored, distributed, or sold by a business complies with the prescribed safety and hygiene standards. Once registered, the business is issued a unique 14-digit FSSAI license number that must be printed on all food packages and displayed at the place of business. This license not only builds consumer trust but also serves as proof of credibility and compliance with Indian food safety laws.FSSAI registration is categorized into three types depending on the size and turnover of the business. Small food businesses with an annual turnover of up to ₹12 lakh are required to obtain FSSAI Basic Registration. Medium-sized businesses with turnover between ₹12 lakh and ₹20 crore must apply for an FSSAI State License, while large food businesses with turnover above ₹20 crore, or those operating in multiple states, are required to obtain a Central FSSAI License. Each category of license has different documentation requirements and levels of scrutiny, but the objective remains the same—ensuring that consumers have access to safe, hygienic, and quality food.",
