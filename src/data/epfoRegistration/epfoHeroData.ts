  question: "What Is EPFO Registration?",
  answer:
    // "EPFO Registration is the official process through which an employer or establishment is enrolled under the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO). It ensures that employees are included in the Provident Fund (PF) scheme, a compulsory social security program that supports workers financially after retirement, during medical emergencies, or in the event of death.",
    "EPFO Registration is the official process through which an employer or establishment is brought under the purview of the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), a statutory body under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India. The primary aim of this registration is to ensure that employees are covered under the Provident Fund (PF) scheme, which is one of the most important social security programs in the country. By registering with EPFO, an employer takes responsibility for deducting and depositing contributions toward the PF account of each eligible employee, thereby securing their long-term financial well-being.The Provident Fund scheme is designed to provide employees with financial stability and security after retirement, but it also serves as a crucial safety net during unexpected situations such as medical emergencies, job loss, or even in the unfortunate event of the employee’s death. Both the employer and employee contribute a fixed percentage of the employee’s salary (currently 12% of basic wages plus dearness allowance, in most cases) to the Provident Fund, which accumulates with interest over time. This not only helps employees build a retirement corpus but also ensures that they have access to partial withdrawals for housing, healthcare, education, and other essential needs.EPFO Registration is mandatory for establishments with 20 or more employees, although smaller establishments can also voluntarily register to provide PF benefits to their workers. Once registered, the employer is allotted an Establishment Identification Number (Establishment ID) by the EPFO.",
