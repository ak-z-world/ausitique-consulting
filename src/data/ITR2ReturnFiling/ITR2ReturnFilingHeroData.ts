  question: "What Is ITR-2 Return Filing?",
  answer:
    "ITR-2 is one of the most commonly used income tax return forms in India, specifically designed for individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who do not earn income from business or profession. This form is applicable to taxpayers who have income from multiple sources such as salary or pension, more than one house property, capital gains from the sale of property, shares or mutual funds, as well as income from foreign assets or overseas sources. Unlike ITR-1 (Sahaj), which is meant for taxpayers with simpler income structures, ITR-2 is mandatory for individuals with more complex financial situations, including those with agricultural income above ₹5,000, lottery or betting income, or foreign bank accounts and assets.Filing ITR-2 is essential because it ensures compliance with the Income Tax Act and helps individuals accurately report their capital gains, foreign income, and multiple property ownership details. It is particularly important for residents, non-residents, and RNORs (Resident but Not Ordinarily Resident) who are required to disclose overseas assets and income earned abroad. Moreover, submitting ITR-2 on time not only prevents penalties and late fees under Section 234F but also helps in claiming eligible deductions under sections like 80C, 80D, and 80G, while maintaining a valid financial record for future needs such as loan applications or visa approvals.",
